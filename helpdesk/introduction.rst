ATI Research Computing Service Helpdesk
=======================================

This chapter contains information about the Helpdesk for the ATI Research Computing Service.
This Helpdesk is run by `EPCC <https://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk>`_.

EPCC Helpdesk
-------------

The Helpdesk is the first point of contact for all questions relating to the ATI 
research computing services hosted by EPCC.

Support is available Monday to Friday from 08:30 until 18:00, excluding 
UK public holidays.

The Helpdesk can be reached by e-mail research-computing-support@turing.ac.uk.

Please try and provide as much background information as possible as this will 
speed up the processing time considerably. Existing ATI research computing 
service  users will be asked for their user ID, project code, and, where applicable, 
the commands they are using and the error message they get.

How the helpdesk ticket system works
------------------------------------

When a query is submitted by email it is placed in the ATI SAFE query system 
(see :doc:`../safe-guide/introduction`).

When you email your query, you will normally get an automatic acknowledgment by email, 
including a tracking ID, within a few minutes. If you submit your query through SAFE, 
it will give you a tracking ID at once. A few minutes later, your query will be 
assigned to the appropriate expert within the ATI to handle.

The expert may contact you to discuss your problem or to get extra information. 
Finally, the expert will send you an answer, and the query will be closed. At this 
point the helpdesk will send you another message, telling you that this has happened.

Closed queries are kept in the ATI SAFE database, so that we can refer back to them when 
solving future problems, and when writing documentation, etc. 

The ATI SAFE database is protected by the :doc:`personal-data-privacy-policy`.
