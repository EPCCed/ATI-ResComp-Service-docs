ATI Research Computing Service
==============================
  
The ATI Research Computing Service are data science platforms hosted by EPCC for the Alan Turing Institute.

The ATI Research Computing Service consists of: 

- a Helpdesk, run by EPCC.
- a Cray Urika GX system. 

This documentation contains:

- :ref:`Helpdesk`: general information on how to contact the Helpdesk.
- :ref:`ATISAFEDocumentation`: general information on how to use the ATI SAFE for helpdesk and support, managing user accounts and project research computing resources, and obtaining resource usage reports.
- :ref:`CrayUrikaUserGuide`: general information on how to access and connect to this system. 

How we collect, use and share information about your use of the service are explained in the  :doc:`helpdesk/personal-data-privacy-policy`.

How the information you provide is used to administer your use of the services through the ATI SAFE helpdesk software is explained `here <https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk/ati/privacy_policy.jsp>`_.
