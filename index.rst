ATI Research Computing Service
==============================
  
The ATI Research Computing Service is a data science platform hosted by EPCC for the Alan Turing Institute.

This documentation is based on the `Cirrus Documentation <http://www.cirrus.ac.uk/docs/>`_ which itself draws on the `Sheffield Iceberg Documentation <https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/wrgrid/iceberg>`_
and the documentation for the `ARCHER National Supercomputing Service <http://www.archer.ac.uk>`_.

The ATI Research Computing Service currently consists of: 

- a Cray Urika GX system. 

This documentation contains:

- :ref:`CrayUrikaUserGuide`: general information on how to access and connect to this system. 
- :ref:`ATISAFEDocumentation`: general information on how to use the ATI SAFE for helpdesk and support, managing user accounts and project research computing resources, and obtaining resource usage reports.
