Alan Turing Institute Research Computing Service
================================================
  
The Alan Turing Institute Research Computing Service are data science platforms hosted by `EPCC <https://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk>`_ for the `Alan Turing Institute <https://www.turing.ac.uk>`_.

The Alan Turing Institute Research Computing Service consists of: 

- a Helpdesk, run by EPCC.
- a Cray Urika-GX service.

This documentation contains:

- :ref:`Helpdesk`: general information on how to contact the Helpdesk.
- :ref:`SafeDocumentation`: general information on how to use the Turing's SAFE for helpdesk and support, managing user accounts and project research computing resources, and obtaining resource usage reports.
- :ref:`CrayUrikaGxUserGuide`: general information on how to access, connect to and use the Turing's Cray Urika-GX service.

How we collect, use and share information about your use of the service are explained in the :doc:`helpdesk/personal-data-privacy-policy`.

How the information you provide is used to administer your use of the services through SAFE is explained in the `SAFE Privacy Policy <https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk/ati/privacy_policy.jsp>`_.
