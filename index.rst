ATI Research Computing Service
==============================
  
The ATI Research Computing Service is a data science platform hosted by EPCC for the Alan Turing Institute.

This documentation is based on the `Cirrus Documentation <http://www.cirrus.ac.uk/docs/>`_ which itself draws on the `Sheffield Iceberg Documentation <https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/wrgrid/iceberg>`_ and the documentation for the `ARCHER National Supercomputing Service <http://www.archer.ac.uk>`_.

The ATI Research Computing Service currently consists of: 

- a Helpdesk, run by EPCC.
- a Cray Urika GX system. 
- the Alan Turing Institute Remote Access Service (Atiras), a Secure Safe Haven with an Intel cluster.

This documentation contains:

- :ref:`Helpdesk`: general information on how to contact the Helpdesk.
- :ref:`ATISAFEDocumentation`: general information on how to use the ATI SAFE for helpdesk and support, managing user accounts and project research computing resources, and obtaining resource usage reports.
- :ref:`CrayUrikaUserGuide`: general information on how to access, connect to and use the Cray Urika GX system. 
- :ref:`AtirasSecureSafeHavenIntelUserGuide`: general information on how to access, connect to and use Atiras.

How we collect, use and share information about your use of the service are explained in the  :doc:`helpdesk/personal-data-privacy-policy`.

How the information you provide is used to administer your use of the services through the ATI SAFE helpdesk software is explained `here <https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk/ati/privacy_policy.jsp>`_.
