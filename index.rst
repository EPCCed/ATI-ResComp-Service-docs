ATI Research Computing Service
==============================
  
The ATI Research Computing Service is a data science platform hosted by EPCC for the Alan Turing Institute.

This documentation is based on the `Cirrus Documentation <http://www.cirrus.ac.uk/docs/>`_ which itself draws on the `Sheffield Iceberg Documentation <https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/wrgrid/iceberg>`_and the documentation for the `ARCHER National Supercomputing Service <http://www.archer.ac.uk>`_.

The ATI Research Computing Service currently consists of: 

- a Helpdesk, run by EPCC.
- a Cray Urika GX system. 
- an Intel cluster within a Secure Safe Haven, accessed via the Alan Turing Institute Remote Access service (Atiras).

This documentation contains:

- :ref:`Helpdesk`: general information on how to contact the Helpdesk.
- :ref:`ATISAFEDocumentation`: general information on how to use the ATI SAFE for helpdesk and support, managing user accounts and project research computing resources, and obtaining resource usage reports.
- :ref:`CrayUrikaUserGuide`: general information on how to access and connect to the Cray Urika GX system. 
- :ref:`AtirasIntelSecureSafeHaven`: general information on how to acces and connect to the Alan Turing Institute Remote Access Service (Atiras) and the Intel cluster within the Secure Safe Haven.

How we collect, use and share information about your use of the service are explained in the  :doc:`helpdesk/personal-data-privacy-policy`.

How the information you provide is used to administer your use of the services through the ATI SAFE helpdesk software is explained `here <https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk/ati/privacy_policy.jsp>`_.
