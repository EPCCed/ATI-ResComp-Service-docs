Alan Turing Institute SAFE Overview
===================================

The Turing's SAFE is a web-based application that is used for:

* Administering Alan Turing Institute Research Computing Service user accounts.
* Managing account a project resources (kAU, disk quotas, etc.)
* Reporting on usage of the system.
* Helpdesk and support.

SAFE for individual users
-------------------------

All users have accounts on the Turing's `SAFE <https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk/ati>`_ through which they can view the resources they have access to, administer their account, query their usage of the service, and submit support requests.

More information on performing these tasks can be found in :doc:`safe-guide-users`.

SAFE for project leaders
------------------------

Project leaders (PI's and any designated project managers) can also use the Turing's `SAFE <https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk/ati>`_ to approve requests to join the project, manage their project resources on the Turing's Research Computing Service, and generate reports on the project usage on the Turing's Research Computing Service.

More information on performing these tasks can be found in :doc:`safe-guide-pi`.
