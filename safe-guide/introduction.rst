ATI SAFE Overview
=================

The SAFE is a web-based application that is used for:

* Administering ATI service user accounts
* Managing account a project resources (kAU, disk quotas, etc.)
* Reporting on usage of the system
* Helpdesk and support

ATI SAFE for individual users
-----------------------------

All ATI users have accounts on the `ATI SAFE <https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk/ati>`_ through which they can view the resources they have access to, administer their account,
query their usage of the service, and submit support requests.

More information on performing these tasks can be found in the
:doc:`safe-guide-users` chapter.

ATI SAFE for project leaders
----------------------------

Project leaders (PI's and any designated project managers) can also
use the `ATI SAFE <https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk/ati>`_ to approve requests to join the project, manage their
project resources on the ATI service, and generate reports on the project 
usage on the ATI service.

More information on performing these tasks can be found in the
:doc:`safe-guide-pi` chapter.
